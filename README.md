# predicting-rural-gentrification-
Data and code for CASA dissertation, looking to identify and predict gentrification within rural communities. 
***
Contents of notebooks as follows: 
##### 1. Census Data Collection - Collecting all data from 2001 to 2011 for LSOAs within Kent to create a comprehensive LSOA profile.
2. Ranking LSOAs Prep - Cleaning data for stage 1, census-derived ascending classification
3A. Ranking LSOAs - creating CI scores and ranking LSOAs to identify ascending categories using census data
3B. Clustering Ascending - Clustering ascending LSOAs to find typologies of neighbourhood change using census data
3C. Clustering Gentrifrying - Clustering Gentryging LSOAs to find nuance within gentrification, using census data
4. POI Data Prep - prepping point of interest data for analysis
5. Now Casting Data Prep - cleaning data for stage 1, Now-Casting derived ascending classification
6. Now Casting Ranking LSOAs - creating CI scores and ranking LSOAs to identify ascending categories, using Now-Casting data
7A. Clustering ascending LSOAs - to find typologies of neighbourhood change using NC data and all domains.
7B. Clustering ascending LSOAs - to find typologies of neighbourhood change, using NC data and only development and demographic domains (not included in final work).
7C. Clustering ascending LSOAs -  to find typologies of neighbourhood change, using NC data and only creative and cultural domains (not included in final work).
8. ML Development - developing model for prediction of ascending/gentrifying. (only Model 3 was discussed in the final work).
